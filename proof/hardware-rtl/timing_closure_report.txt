4. Conclusion
-------------
The AIPP-SH Gate achieves timing closure at 1GHz in a 5nm process with significant slack (+320 ps). 
The 8-stage pipeline ensures that no logic path exceeds 12 gate levels, allowing the gate to process 
packets at line rate with deterministic nanosecond latency. This IP is "Tape-out Ready" for 
integration into high-performance network switch SoCs.
