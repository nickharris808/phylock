## PRIOR ART DEFENSE

### Novelty Differentiators by Family

| Family | Key Novelty | Prior Art Gap |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| **ARC-3** | CSI → HKDF → NAS + <100ns HW | No prior art binds CSI to 5G security |
| **D-Gate+** | FSM + permit + Z3 + E911 | No prior art combines all four |
| **PQLock** | ML-KEM + CBT + TLV-E compat | No backward-compatible 5G hybrid PQC |
| **U-CRED** | CBOR/PQC + quota + delegation | No stateless edge with embedded quotas |
| **QSTF-V2** | PQC chunking + streaming + eDRX | No PQC for 50KB IoT devices |

### Prior Art Density Assessment

| Family | Patent Density | Literature Density | Overall Risk |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|--------------|
| ARC-3 | Medium | High | Low-Medium |
| D-Gate+ | Low | Medium | Low |
| PQLock | Medium | Medium | Low |
| U-CRED | High | High | Medium |
| QSTF-V2 | Low | Low | Very Low |

| Licensing leverage | Low | High | N/A |
| Design-around | Easy | Impossible | N/A |
| FRAND obligation | None | Required | Balanced |

### Portfolio B Estimated Royalty Stack

| U-CRED | 4 | 0.3% |
| QSTF-V2 | 5 | 0.5% |
| **Total** | **25** | **2.8% gross** |

**After Stacking Discount (30-50%):** 1.4-2.0% net royalty

### Revenue Projection (Conservative)
