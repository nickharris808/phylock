## WHAT WAS COMPLETED

### Phase 1: Soft Coupling ✅
- ✅ Implemented 3 core soft coupling integrations:
  1. PQLock + ARC-3: CSI entropy binding
  2. D-Gate+ + Knot: Grid clock source  
  3. QSTF + PQLock: Silicon reuse
- ✅ Created circular_dependency_proof.py (degradation model)

### Phase 2: Economic Honesty ✅
- ✅ Updated ARC-3 rNPV to show dual valuation
  - Realistic: $28.8M (÷52)
  - Optimistic: $1.49B (current)
- ✅ Clear labeling in all rNPV outputs

### Phase 3: Patent Documentation ✅
- ✅ PATENT_FAMILIES_COMPLETE.md (legal team guide)
- ✅ PATENT_CLAIMS_WITH_DATA.md (evidence package)
- ✅ Both include prior art risk disclosure

### Phase 4: Critical Documentation ✅
