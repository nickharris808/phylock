## ⚠️ ISSUES FOUND (ALL NON-BLOCKING)

### Minor Issues (2) - COSMETIC
1. Output format mismatch in PQLock downgrade (logic works)
2. Output format mismatch in cold-boot (logic works)

**Fix Time:** 1 hour  
**Blocking:** NO (just string matching)

### Moderate Issues (3) - OPERATIONAL
1. D-Gate+ permit rate limiting (design consideration)
2. FSM integer overflow bounds (Z3 constraint missing)
3. Market timing (6G deployment timeline)

**Fix Time:** 3 hours  
**Blocking:** NO (can address during integration)

### Already Fixed Issues (5) ✅
1. ✅ Gate count unfair → Fixed with O(k³) fair baseline
2. ✅ DPA synthetic → Fixed with Hamming Weight model
3. ✅ Grid PLL simplified → Fixed with PI controller
4. ✅ Pilot cherry-picked → Fixed with 1000-env Monte Carlo
5. ✅ No sensitivity → Fixed with 4 comprehensive analyses
