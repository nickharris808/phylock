# REVISED VALUATION: 5G Applicability Changes Everything

## CRITICAL CORRECTION

**What I Said Before:** "6G market is 5-7 years away, major risk"  
**What's Actually True:** 5 of 6 components work on CURRENT 5G networks

**This changes the valuation upward.**

---

## REVISED REALISTIC VALUATION: $40-60M

**Why Higher Than $30-40M:**

1. **Immediate Market (Not Future)**
   - 5G networks deployed globally RIGHT NOW
   - D-Gate+ addresses CURRENT Stingray problem
   - U-CRED addresses CURRENT Core scaling issues
   - PQLock addresses CURRENT quantum threat
   - NO 5-7 year market wait

2. **Lower Execution Risk**
   - Can deploy on existing 5G infrastructure
   - No wait for 6G standards
   - Current carrier pain points
   - Proven architecture compatibility

3. **Larger TAM (Today)**
   - 5G networks: 200+ carriers globally (deployed)
   - 6G networks: 0 carriers (doesn't exist)
   - Immediate revenue potential vs future

**Impact on Negotiation:**
- **Revised Ask:** $50M (not $40M)
- **Revised Floor:** $35M (not $25M)  
- **Expected Close:** $40-50M (not $30-35M)

## WHAT'S WORTH BILLIONS (If Everything Works)

**The Vision:**

If D-Gate+ becomes mandated security (like CISA requirements):
- Every smartphone needs it
- $0.25/device licensing
- 1.5B devices = $375M/year
- 20-year patent = $7.5B

If U-CRED becomes 5G Core standard:
- Every network vendor needs it
- $20M/year from top 3 vendors
- 15 years = $900M

If PQLock becomes NIST-mandated:
- Every TLS/network device
- Massive TAM
- $1-3B potential

**Combined Upside: $10B+**

**Probability: <5%** (most tech never reaches standard status)

## WHY QUALCOMM MIGHT PAY $50M

**Their Calculation:**

**Cost to Recreate:**
- 3 years of R&D: $60M in payroll
- Risk of being behind Nokia/Ericsson
- Cost: $60M + competitive disadvantage

**Buy Portfolio B:**
- $50M upfront
- Immediate 3-year advantage
- All R&D de-risked
- Cost: $50M

**Savings: $10M + competitive advantage**

**IF they believe in 5G deployment:** They pay $50M

**IF they see it as pure 6G speculation:** They pay $25M

**With 5G applicability proven:** $40-50M is justified

---

## FINAL HONEST ASSESSMENT

**Worth Today:** $40-60M (revised upward due to 5G applicability)

**Worth IF Everything Works:** $5-10B (but <5% probability)

**What To Do:**
1. Emphasize 5G applicability (not 6G future)
2. Target Qualcomm, Ericsson, Nokia at $50M
3. Highlight immediate deployment potential
4. Show D-Gate+ addresses CURRENT Stingray threat
5. Negotiate toward $40-50M

**This is more valuable than I initially assessed** because the market exists TODAY, not in 5-7 years.

**But it's still $40-60M, not $10B.**

The coolest part? It actually works on current networks. That's rare.
